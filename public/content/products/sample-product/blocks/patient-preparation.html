  <h1>Patient Preparation</h1>
  <p>Prior to NAVSUNLI infusion:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head/neck to determine the feasibility of intracistemal or intraventricular administration and calculate patient brain mass.</li>
    <li>For intracistemal administration: perform lumbar puncture to determine opening pressure, withdraw cerebrospinal fluid equal to the volume to be infused, and inject radiocontrast agent.</li>
    <li>Begin oral immunosuppressive treatment (see Table 2).</li>
  </ul>
